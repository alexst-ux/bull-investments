#Investment Tracker

> wealth whispers when money speaks

The Investment Tracker is a powerful tool that allows users to track and manage their investments while accurately calculating profit and loss in their preferred currency. Users can input their investments and monitor performance over various periods, including daily, monthly, and overall. The app provides detailed visualizations, such as:

- Monthly investment trends
- Investment pie charts by stock
- Unrealized profit/loss over time by month

The standout feature of the app is the ability to switch between currencies (USD, EUR, PLN, GBP) and **calculate precise yields in the selected currency**. This ensures that users see the correct invested amount, unrealized gain, unrealized percent, and market value for each currency, portfolio, and stock.

**Problem Solved**: The app solves the common issue of incorrect profit/loss calculation in volatile currency environments. Many existing tools fail to account for this when calculating yield, particularly for currencies like PLN. The Investment Tracker provides an accurate picture, even when market and currency volatility are highâ€”e.g., showing a 35% gain in USD but only 20% in PLN due to exchange rate fluctuations.

**Technologies**: Built with React for the frontend and Supabase for backend services, ensuring efficient performance and real-time data updates.
